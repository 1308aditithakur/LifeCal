## 🌟 Vision

I built LifeCal with a simple but strong vision:  
> ✨ *To give your personal life the same beautiful, functional planning system your work calendar has—but with more soul.*

In a world full of productivity apps that feel cold, cluttered, or overly corporate, LifeCal is a soft space.  
It’s your peachy personal planner—a dashboard to check in with yourself, not just your deadlines.
